## Overview
Euclid is a 3D modeling tool that combines a traditional modeling workflow with AI-assisted 3D generation. The goal is to reduce the time between “idea” and “usable model” by letting you generate a base mesh with AI and then refine it with standard editing tools.

## Key Features
- **AI-assisted 3D generation** to create a starting model from a prompt or input
- **Modeling + editing workflow** to refine generated meshes (not just view them)
- **Cross-platform desktop UI** built with Avalonia
- **Real-time viewport rendering** using OpenGL + GLSL
- **Tooling-focused design**: fast iteration, clear controls, and practical export-ready results
