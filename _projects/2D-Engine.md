## Overview
A custom 2D engine written in C++ using OpenGL for rendering. It’s built to support a simple scene workflow, fast iteration, and editor-style tools (via ImGui). The goal is to keep the core small and understandable while still being practical for real projects.

## Key Features
- **2D rendering pipeline** with textured quads and basic batching
- **Shader system** (GLSL) for materials and effects
- **Scene / object structure** to organize game content
- **ImGui-based editor tools** for debugging and quick iteration
- **JSON serialization** for saving/loading engine or scene data
- **Input + camera controls** for testing and navigation
