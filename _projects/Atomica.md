## Overview
Atomica is an interactive atom construction simulator built in C++ with OpenGL. It lets you build atoms by adding particles and immediately see the result visually. On top of the simulation, an educational AI layer (Gemini API) helps explain what you’re building in simple terms and answers questions about structure, trends, and basic chemistry/physics concepts.

## Key Features
- **Interactive atom builder** for creating and editing atoms in real time
- **Real-time rendering** with OpenGL + GLSL for responsive visuals
- **ImGui UI** for controls, parameters, and debugging tools
- **Educational AI layer** (Gemini API) to explain results and answer questions
- **Clear feedback loop**: change the atom → instantly see the impact on the model
