# [Shader Interface](https://github.com/MuzychenkoNikita/ShaderInterface)
### Application inspired by [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com) - a website for shader art programming and sharing. My iteration is expanded in shader input options and has no limits for it's number. Shader Interface has simple and clear interface made with ImGui and makes all renderings in real-time. There are also options for configurations like screen ration and time passed to shader.
### It has support for Windows, MacOS and Linux. Work is still in progress, I am planing to add options for video file outputs and work on overall optimization of the application.
