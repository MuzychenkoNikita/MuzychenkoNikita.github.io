# [2D Engine](https://github.com/MuzychenkoNikita/2D-Engine)
### Open-Source library that is simplifying process of 2D game development on OpenGL. Repository splited into library itself and example game application with showcase of using functions and building actual game. Has implemented texture atlas class with rect packing algorithm usage for optimization. Supports Windows, MacOS and Linux. Planing to add scripting for levels and level editor as another section of repository.

# [Shader Interface](https://github.com/MuzychenkoNikita/ShaderInterface)
### Application inspired by [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com) - a website for shader art programming and sharing. My iteration is expanded in shader input options and has no limits for it's number. Shader Interface has simple and clear interface made with ImGui and makes all renderings in real-time. There are also options for configurations like screen ration and time passed to shader.
### It has support for Windows, MacOS and Linux. Work is still in progress, I am planing to add options for video file outputs and work on overall optimization of the application.

# [MixerGL](https://github.com/MuzychenkoNikita/MixerGL)
### 3D modeling software inspired by [Blender](https://www.blender.org) software. This application is very simple to use, has basic functionality for interacting with objects. You can use either your mouse or object setting list to change states. Also supports texture uploading for shapes placed on scene. Windows, MacOS and Linux are all supported.
